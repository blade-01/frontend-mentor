- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## My process

### Built with

- [Vue JS](https://v3.vuejs.org/)

### Useful resources

- [UUID](https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid) - A random ID generator, this helped in generating random id for my todo list items.
- Drag and drop just got easier with [Vue-Draggable](https://sortablejs.github.io/vue.draggable.next/#/simple), check out their repo for more info.
- [ResponsivelyApp](https://responsively.app) - This extension helped me in viewing my projects in every viewport which helped improve the responsiveness of the game.
